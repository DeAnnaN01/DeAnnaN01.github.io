                I enjoy fixing things. For example I can fix cellphones and laptops. I really enjoy when it involves opening it up and soldering on the board or replacing components.

                One of my most favorite hobbies is driving my Mini Cooper out on the country roads listening to my music loudly. It is a good way for me to release any built up aggressions or stress I may have.

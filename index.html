                    This is a simple shopping list that I created using React-Native. It has a version for both iOS Apple devices, Android devices, as well as web browsers. It allows you to add things to your list with the option of including additional subcomment notes for each item. When added, the items are neatly displayed in a list in the order added with an empty checkbox beside it. When the item has been obtained you can check the box and cross the item out by merely tapping on the item in the list. To undo simply tap again. To delete the items crossed out, press the red delete button at the bottom of the screen.

                    This app was created for use while I assisted my mother with her grocery shopping every week. It was a great help to make sure we got everything we came for without having to use the paper and pen approach since I found it to be too much hassle.

                    I enjoy fixing things. For example I can fix cellphones and laptops. I really enjoy when it involves opening it up and soldering on the board or replacing components.

                    One of my most favorite hobbies is driving my Mini Cooper out on the country roads listening to my music loudly. It is a good way for me to release any built up aggressions or stress I may have.
